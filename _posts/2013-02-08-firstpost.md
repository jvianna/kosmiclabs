title: Goodbye Wordpress, Hello Jekyll

For the longest time, I have been frustrated dealing with Wordpress and its bloated interface. Every time I attempt to start/restart blogging, I create a new theme, get it all ready, but as soon as I have to deal with the interface, a wave of disappointment comes crashing and I give up. After going through the same process several times, I told myself that I would refrain from setting up another blog because I would end up quitting again and waste a good amount of hours in the process. 

I was confident I would never have an active blog. That was true until I bumped into [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) while working on a project at my job. I had only heard of it until then, but never really had the time to look into it. I was pleased. After working with Jekyll for a couple of days, I realized that it was a very intuitive tool. Also, it wasn't nearly as bloated as Wordpress and significantly more customizable, at least for my plans, which were to use it to finally start a blog that I'd manage to keep updated.
